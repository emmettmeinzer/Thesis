12,c19nkly,t3_eodzb,"Here's how you convince yourself with logic and reasoning:

Hundreds of thousands of people fly on planes every day.
The mechanics of plane flight are well-known.
You are far more likely to die in a car accident.
Planes are kept well-maintained and have many redundant back-up systems.
In fact, planes CAN perform emergency landings when over sea. It's just as safe of an emergency landing. Every plane is equipped with life boats, life vests, every piece of equipment needed to KEEP YOU ALIVE, no matter what.
Most planes are almost entirely automatic. They can take off, fly, and even land nearly without human interaction. Do you trust your cell phone to connect you to whomever you want? Do you trust your email to get to the right person? Then you can trust doubly the high-performance machinery flying that plane.

Remember, these corporations make billions of dollars by making sure that they have operational planes. It's bad press if a flight crashes due to any error.

I hope this has at least partially helped.",t3_eodzb,1292813652,2,12/19/10 21:54,eodzb

Read a couple of articles on just how safe flying is; I highly recommend http://www.fearofflyinghelp.com/ (I have no affiliation to this site whatsoever).

Sadly i have to fly for work quite often, but i finally went to see a doctor about it and was prescribed low level Valium for when i have to fly, something like 10mg. I normally take one about 20 minutes before i board and then one more if i have a layover before a connecting flight. It makes a WORLD of difference, 98% of the in flight anxiety is gone and i can travel for work without the added stress.

17,c19nqlb,t3_eodzb,"I had the same problem, but I overcame it.  You have a phobia.  Phobia's are irrational, and in your case, it sounds like a control phobia.  The key to 'beating' those, is not to try to win, but to let yourself give up.  The more you try to win, the worse your phobia will become.  Accept that you are not in control.  Accept that you could crash, but that we all die, and what can you do about it?  After you can accept that, then, and only then, can you let your logic come back in to convince yourself that you are in a relatively safe situation.

Oh, yeah, and take some Xanax.

18,c19nzkx,t3_eodzb,"Same problem. Terrified of the planes. I've done two things to combat the fear:

I got myself a rubix cube and spend the time during take-off, landing, and turbulence solving the hell out of that cube. I can solve the whole thing during take off and landing, but once i'm on solid ground, my rubix cube skills go away and I can't even get one side done.

I also play a game called ""secret identity."" I pretend to be someone else (think like rodger from american dad, just without the costume). I make up my whole backstory while I talk to the person sitting next to me or across from me on the plane. I've been a lot of people. I flew to LA in october and was Alec Baldwin's secret daughter. I never came out and said it, but i dropped a lot of hints. Hard to tell if they bought it, but it's a possiblity. Its a good game and you're so busy keeping track of what ""lie"" you told this other person that you don't have time to be scared. ",t3_eodzb,1292821355,1,12/20/10 0:02,eodzb
19,c19nijd,t3_eodzb,"I wrote this on my iPhone as I was flying to New York. Thought it was relevant...

I awoke shivering on an airplane. My cheap blanket had fallen to my ankles so I bent down and wrapped it around me once more. All around me hushed Asian night sounds filled the cabin. I turned to look out the window at the 35,000 feet night sky. I found Orion's belt and felt content.

I checked my watch. Three hours till landing in Denver international, that center of weird, guarded faithfully by that red-eyed demon horse. There was a great place to get eggs Benedict...

Opening up my laptop, I contented myself to write down the dream I had just awoken from. There had been green ocean waves crashing all around a small island, ivy wrapped roofed pillars surrounding the whole thing. I had been flying over, arms spread as if to embrace this place I knew. Soft stringed music floated out from the forests.

I finished up the details and closed the laptop, placing it neatly beneath my seat once more. I did not want to be on this flight. Flying is bad enough but having to do it because a loved one died is simply wrenching. At least I'll get to see family again.

I settled back in for sleep, securing the blanket the best I could, my head turning to the window to stare at the stars once again. The infinite mass of speckled light seemed to enter my eyes and bring calm warmth to my mind.

My eye lids performed their dance, up and down, ever so slowly until a brighter flash from far below caused them to open wide, my apertures expanding at the sight. The constant light became brighter and bigger, spiraling upwards towards us, thin white smoke trailing faintly behind.

The missile entered the window of the unlucky person (weren't we all) three seats in front of me and time slowed to a fluid crawl. My sight was able to follow the wavering heat from the tail to the red fins attached to the white body, bold USA emblazoned on the side. It spiraled beautifully at an angle through the cabin and punctured through the aluminum on the other side before exploding magnificently, tearing the craft open like JFK's head.

The heat and fire seared us all, and my last moments of consciousness were of blistering wind and falling.
_______________________________

To say I awoke would give discredit to the wonderful peace I became conscious of. I was floating in the ocean, how deep I do not know. I felt a surge pulling at the front of my mind to some place a little higher up, so I swam to find it. Sparkles of light were glistening around me, and rainbow swathes of what could only be jet fuel were ever present.

I saw something amazingly huge above me suddenly. It happened to be the tail of the aircraft I had been in only moments ago. The feeling that was pulling me grew stronger, and I swam to where the plane had been ripped open.

Upon the effort of getting in the right position, I bared witness to the grotesque sight of the dead still strapped to their seats, agony and fear across their faces. My eyes diverted to my seat where I saw the shell I had once inhabited, mouth agape, empty eyes staring out to forever. My hair had been singed completely.

43,dsn6oaf,t3_7q7mkn,"I have an extreme fear of vomit. Whether it be myself vomitting or someone else vommiting will put me in a panic attack. Its a fear that controls me as I think about the possibility of someone else vommitting while I am in any and all situations....especially situations that would typically cause someone to vomit such as amusement parks, parties where people are drinking alochol, crowded transportation (buses, trains, planes and even car rides with people I do not typically drive with). I have that anxiety with me always. If I ever think I am going to vomit, it puts me in a panic attack or can make me completely unconcentrated on anything but the bad feeling in my stomach. Because of this, I avoid eating out as it increases my chances of food poisoning and when cooking meat, I cook it until its dry just to be sure its completely cooked. Although I have only thrown up two times in my entire life. If I suspect someone else might vomit, I try to leave that situation as fast as possible. I can no longer sleep without white noise as it helps to block out any possible sound coming from my neighbors (I live in an apartment). My fear consumes me. 
How I deal with it? I know I cant stop my life for it so I still push myself to be in those situations that are described above. The only situation I can truly avoid is amusement parks since they are not a necessary part of life. Otherwise, I keep my fears to myself and share it with those closest to me when I feel uneasy about the situation.

I got over it by rationalising, and deliberately stepping on cracks without counting. Realistically, stepping on cracks in the pavement has no effect on the things in the world. 
And I had a friend share a bible verse relevant to me. ""The steps of a righteous person are ordered by The Lord.""


I also used to be terrified of the dark, especially being inside at night, terrified of who or what could be outside.

That one I dealt with by 1) asking friends to pray for me. 2) Memorising bible verses about fear and anxiety. Eg: 2 Timothy 1:7 ""The lord has not given you a spirit of fear, but a spirit of power and love and a sound mind. I now walk around my house at night in the dark without issues.

Prepare her for the take off, what to expect and all the way through the flight so there are no surprises. Let her look through the emergency procedures card so she's confident of the exits and their locations.

There is nothing normal about people cramming themselves into a metal tube and flying at several hundreds of miles an hour through the air. Trying to 'normalize' the experience can help her get over it from the beginning.

And if she drinks, a couple drinks on the flight to loosen her up really does help. Not to the point of falling down obviously but to 'take the edge off' will benefit her. 

That first flight will help with the rest of the experiences from then onwards.

There are a few phobias that come into play with flying. One obviously is claustrophobia and the other is basically the fear of crashing and dying! I think every flyer ever to get on a plane lives with a small percentage of that one each & every time.

Look up the type of plane you'll be flying on, show her photos of it, what it looks like inside and make sure she is well prepared for it.

Your brain is a powerful thing, and your body will do whatever it is told, keep that in mind.  

This is an example of how I would analyze:
Why am I scared of airplane ride?
-Because I could crash
-Because I dont like it when they shake
-I dont want to die

Are these fears rational? 
(Crash) Well, hundreds of thousands of planes fly every day and I almost never hear of a major crash.... so this doesn't seem likely that mine is going to crash.. My family and friends all fly every now and then, they never crash. I could crash, but there is a VERY low risk. I even read once that you are more likely to get struck by lightening than crash, have I ever got struck by lightening? It doesn't seem likely that I would crash...

Now tell yourself and believe that you are not going to crash because it isn't likely  (which it isn't)

I try to book in a row close to the galley; the flight attendants have a very calming presence. 4. Enjoy the view! If you're flying over land, grab a map and look for landmarks. 5. If your airline offers the ""cockpit station,"" listen to it. You will hear just how relaxed and confident the pilots are even during very bumpy rides.

4004,ceo6yuq,t3_1v2wmp,"I was sitting at the emergency exit on the wing of the plane. Halfway through the 5 hour flight, me and my friend heard a loud ""WHUMP"" near the wing. It shook the plane a little. That freaked me out, but we were still flying fine. Then when we started to descend, the engine on that wing started vibrating. I don't mean a tiny vibration. I mean loud-deep-thrumming-in-your-chest-something-is-about-to-go-horribly-wrong kind of vibrating. 

After about 10 minutes of this, the engine whined and then I heard it TURN OFF. That was the most frightening bit, when I realized one of the engines had definitely failed. I began to have a panic attack, while my friend is trying to tell me there are so many back-ups and the pilot knows what he is doing. But crap, that was scary. The pilot then announced that one of the engines had gone out (no duh) and they would land with only 3. 

During the slow, 30 minute descent, that plane was the most silent/tension filled place ever. No one was speaking, everyone was gripping their chairs, the lady next to me had taken a xanax. When we touched down, we fishtailed for a moment and then straightened out. The entire cabin burst into applause. I was relieved that I wasn't the only one freaking out (I have anxiety and can turn anything into a disaster in my brain). As we pulled up to the gate, there were ambulances and firetrucks, as this was technically an emergency landing (even though we were at the correct airport). 

Turns out that the ""WHUMP"" I had heard was the sound of a giant chunk of ice being sucked into the engine. Right before we took off, the stewardesses announced that there was a plumbing issue and we didn't have running water in the bathrooms. Not a huge deal, thought they could fix it at the next stop. But the loss of water was actually due to a leak. When we got to altitude, the leak formed into a quickly growing chunk of ice that eventually flew into the engine.

Looking back on this, there was a lot more that could have gone wrong. I don't think we were ever in any actual life threatening danger. But it was terrifying, especially since I have panic disorder and a fear of flying.

TL;DR An engine went out, I panicked, everyone survived.

You might want to read up on the statistics.  The overwhelming safety of commercial flights is just simply staggering.  A recent article in the New York Times reported the following findings: ""In the last five years, the death risk for passengers in the United States has been one in 45 million flights, according to Arnold Barnett, a professor of statistics at M.I.T. In other words, flying has become so reliable that a traveler could fly every day for an average of 123,000 years before being in a fatal crash...""

I read a statistic once about the number of passengers that the commercial airlines had flown without a fatality and the number was millions of people.  I wish I could find it, because it was a huge number.

I'm not (yet) a pilot but I know a ton of people in the aviation industry. One such person used to be a disaster response liason at a local regional up here in the PNW. She told me this story:

Back when this airline had metroliners, they would sometimes have trouble with prop ice. Usually the ice would sling off the props and there would be no issue, however, in doing so, small chunks of ice would often hit the fuselage. This wasnt a problem for the plane but could be frightening for passengers. 

On this occasion, however, the ice was building up on one prop and wasnt slinging off. The chunk of ice was getting bigger and bigger. 

Eventually though, it finally came off, sling right into the aircraft's fuselage and completely obliterating one of the cabin windows. Fortunately the were already descending to land but unfortunately the unlucky passenger sitting at that window started to be sucked out due to the pressure difference. Fortunately for him this passenger was rather large so only his left half ended up being sucked out the window. Thankfully no obe was hurt since they were close to landing, and it is one of the best stories I've heard about in flight mishaps.

TL;DR: ice breaks window, man gets sucked out, the only benefit to being obese is revealed",t3_1v2wmp,1389623264,26,1/13/14 9:27,1v2wmp
4021,ceob5dz,t3_1v2wmp,"**TL;DR Planned emergency landing, I was as cool as Fonzie.**

I was a young single guy making stupid amounts of money and decided to take a girl I was dating on a weekend trip to Florida.  The trip was awesome, except for the return flight.

We're in a tiny DC9 and about 5 minutes after take off, we smell smoke.  Not cigarette smoke, but like, burning Lionel train transformer ozone electronics-on-fire smoke.  We hear whispers from other passengers ""smell smoke?...""  ""do you smell that?""

Just then two flight attendants come POWER WALKING at top speed from the rear of the plane to the front and buckle themselves in their jump seats.

The plane then banks about as hard as I imagine a plane that size can bank.  Our window was parallel with the ground.  My girl is FLIPPING HER SHIT.  Everyone is screaming, stuff is flying all over the plane, it's chaos.  I'm being Mr. Cool Guy and just patting my girl on the leg, saying it's cool, it'll be ok....

Meanwhile I'm thinking we're going to die - this is it, I'm going to eat it in a fucking plane crash with this girl I've been dating for a month.  I actually thought ""At least I'll go out after a great weekend of food and fucking six times a day...""

Anyway, the plane levels off and begins to decend back to Clearwater.

   Now we get our first communication from the flight staff.  

The flight attendant stands up and says ""We are having some electrical issues, and we are going to attempt a planned emergency landing back at Clearwater to assess the situation.  Please place your head between your knees and ....""  I didn't really hear the rest.

""Planned emergency landing?""  What kind of horseshit is that?

Anyway, we land, deplane, sit in the terminal for 90 minutes while they inspect the fuck out of the plane.

The airline staff assures us that we'll be ready to get back on the plane soon.  My girl says ""There's no way I'm getting back on that plane.  I want a different one.""  Other people are muttering similar things.

I said ""Do you really want to get on a plane that HASN'T been gone over with a fine-tooth-comb for the past 2 hours?""

We're about 30 minutes into the flight, and suddenly there's a loud bang, the plane jerks to the left and drops probably 50 feet or so.  Everyone startled and we all looked around...And then we hit the worst turbulence I've ever been in in my entire life.

The flight attendants scrambled to get to their seats and strap in.  I could feel the pilot trying to go up and then down to get out of it, but for at least five minutes we're being tossed around like a snowglobe.

I have only experienced one thing that i would call a ""worst experience""; I'm an aircraft mechanic, several years ago after i had earned all of my certifications i was working for a charter company and i had taken part in many engine repairs and replacements(business jets). 

We Performed an engine repair on a [Bombardier Global 6000](http://img.planespotters.net/photo/298000/original/N88AA-_PlanespottersNet_298679.jpg), nothing unusual just a simple maintenance job, everything went well. 

The next day the pilots that usually fly her were taking her for an hour and a half long test flight and brought me along, this was my fourth flight with them after engine work.

About 45 minutes into the flight we are at 18,000ft when the number 2 engine cuts out, no warning it just goes. We turn around earlier after notifying ATC and then that's when we realize that we may end up short on gas. You see for this flight we didn't need a full tank which made us light so with two engines we were flying with only about 50% thrust for each engine to maintain speed, now we only had one engine operating at 90% thrust and burning allot more fuel( a strong head wind was further slowing us down needing more fuel) 

By the time we began our descent we were burning into our reserve fuel(a calculated amount of fuel added onto what we need before flight) though thankfully things were looking good, we started our descent late so that we would be descending all the way into final approach thus allowing us to run the engine at idle power, saving gas.

Landing with one engine is scary and tricky for pilots but we came in with a smooth landing and the rest of the day was spent removing the engine and replacing it completely as well as talking to some NTSB investigators.

So that's that, flying is awesome and there is nothing to really worry about, even if the engines fall off you're still flying. ",t3_1v2wmp,1389619145,4,1/13/14 8:19,1v2wmp

It was the middle of the night when we landed in Dakar. I usually sleep through this or wake up long enough to update my family to let them know I'm safe. No such luck sleeping this time.

It wasn't long before it started. Luckily the nearest lavatory was unoccupied. I rushed into that cramped little space and vomited. And vomited some more.

4047,ceoccef,t3_1v2wmp,"Just last week I was flying to New York from San Fransisco with my family. Due to weather, our flight was cancelled and we had to reschedule for a 7AM flight, meaning we have to get up at 4:30 to make the flight. About four hours into the flight, we get an announcement that the plane is having air pressure problems and we need to make an emergency landing in Kansas City. This was odd because we should have passed Kansas at least an hour earlier, but I thought nothing of it at the time. 

We land in the airport, far away from the terminal and are sitting around until the pilot announces that there wasn't actually a cabin pressure leak, but a bomb threat on the plane. Surprisingly, no one starts panicking, and the plane is quite calm as we wait for HALF AN HOUR on a plane with a BOMB THREAT while the airport gets us stairs for us to get off the plane.

We get off the plane to 15 degree weather without our coats and they bus us to the terminal and pen us into a small area while the FBI searches the plane and questions everyone on it. FIVE HOURS of painful boredom later, they announce there wasn't a bomb and we can get back on the plane. However, because of the delay, all three New York City airport have been snowed under and we have to reroute to Boston.

We arrive in Boston at about Midnight, and instead of waiting for accommodations (which some people got but had to wait a few hours), we say fuck it and find a hotel so we can get back on the plane at 9:30 the next morning, not even spending an entire shift at the hotel, the same people were at the desk when we left. 

The flight from Boston to NYC is only 45 minutes long, yet right after leaving the gate, we have to wait 2 hours for them to try and fix a mechanical problem before giving up and cancelling the flight altogether. 

At this point we hate everyone and everything, so we say screw the airline and rent a car to drive 5 hours to NY, and arrive at 7PM, 36 hours after leaving San Francisco.

Also, we found out later that the bomb was actually a camera shaped like a flash drive someone taped to a bathroom wall to watch people pee. Fuck that guy.",t3_1v2wmp,1389630532,3,1/13/14 11:28,1v2wmp
4048,ceod7b2,t3_1v2wmp,"I was at the center of the worst experience ever on a plane, and I'm certain that if the other passengers had been allowed to vote they would have thrown us out at 30,000 feet...sans parachute. While in the middle of a military PCS move my 2 year old son and I were on a 9.5 hour flight from Honolulu to Atlanta (We'd been stationed in Hawaii and were moving back to North Carolina) My son was 2 at the time, and I was flying with him by myself because my husband was deployed. 
When we boarded the plane, early because ""passengers with small children"" I found our seats and was relieved to see that we had the two by the window. With the military being in charge of purchasing the tickets I had no idea where on the plane we'd be sitting. The plane is filling up and my 2 year old son is all content by the window when there is a tap on my shoulder. ""excuse me, but you're in the wrong seat"" I had read the tickets wrong. I asked the man if he would be willing to switch as my son was already settled. his response ""My daughter really wanted the window seat."" oh, so no then. Daughter was about 15, old enough to learn to live with disappointment in my opinion. So of the 4 seats in the center aisle it was random passenger guy on the far side and the man on the side closest to where his wife and daughter were sitting at the window seats, with my son and I being assigned the two seats in the middle of these male bookends. At this point I decide that my toddler son is sitting next to a-hole guy and not random passenger guy. It is at this point in the story that I should tell you my son was deaf at the time. He had already had 2 ear surgeries and was in the process of getting another 2 once we moved. My son was not at all pleased about the new seating arrangement and when you have a pissed off deaf toddler, he refused to use sign language. He would just scream. This high pitched, blood curdling, bone chilling scream that would make your ear drums bleed if you happened to be on the same football field as him when he was screaming. Here I am trying to sign to my son who is absolutely refusing to sign back or even pay attention to me, and we're all trapped in a tin can for 9.5 hours. I thought at some point he would have to give up. I had given him Benadryl before getting on the plane. Turns out he has the OPPOSITE reaction of most people, it doesn't make him tired. It was like having a 2 year old on meth, screaming inconsolably at full volume. He did not stop screaming for the *entire* flight. I am sure that the airline sold a lot of liquor on that trip.

follow-up: He's now 4 years old, has had both additional ear surgeries, can hear and is learning talking. We've never given him Benadryl again and anyone who meets him today with his sunny happy loveable disposition would not believe that he was once an inflight nightmare banshee.

4050,ceogcye,t3_1v2wmp,"My dad died back in England in 2006, on the day we were going to visit him. My wife (American) and I were staying in Manchester for a week, and we were to travel south and meet my sister in Milton Keynes and then the family.

My sister looked ill when we met. Dad had been rushed to the hospital with an aneurysm problem. They wouldn't touch his aneurysm because of his heart, and wouldn't touch his heart because of the aneurysm. I last got to see dad after he had died in the hospital, with a large cover thrown over his torso. He was probably still opened up.

So I had to travel back to America, then back for his funeral. It was the flight from Philadelphia to Gatwick, and there were 150 middle-schoolers off on the same flight. All wearing Union Flag t-shirts, making them conspicuous targets for any and all London pick-pockets and scam artists. Three young lads sat across the aisle from my seat, playing with each others' lights (""you stop it!"" ""no, YOU stop it!""). And thirty minutes after dinner was served, one of the young fellas threw up over the other two.

This wasn't just a little bit of sick. It was like The Exorcist. If there was a Projectile Chunder event at the Olympics, this kid would have won gold for the USA. The stench was unavoidable, and people were fussing over the boys for hours. Changing clothes, wiping things down, being loud.

I got two hours sleep on the flight, tops.

By the time I got through passport control, I knew that Northampton (where my sister lived at the time) was out of the equation. I called one of my sisters and told her to pick me up at Arlesey. There was a Thameslink train at Gatwick, so I went via Kings Cross Thameslink to Kings Cross, avoiding the Underground. I missed one Arlesey train by two minutes, so I called my sis on her mobile and gave her the new ETA. I changed and freshened up at dad's house when I got there.

The funeral was in a small church just a short drive from the house. The funeral company were great, very professional and sombre. I had prepared a eulogy just in case, but my eldest sister had too and she read hers. Then we went outside and buried my dad. We put roses on the coffin, threw dirt in. Dad would have been proud at the turnout. Family, friends, villagers. There was a function in a village pub afterwards, where I showed my eldest sis my version of the eulogy and we were amazed at the similarities. After everything, I eventually got to bed at midnight for six hours sleep.

Then the trip back. For reasons of clarity, I'm now going to give all times at East Coast USA times (even though a lot of this happens in England) because I hadn't been in Britain long enough to switch time-zones in my head. My body is still on East Coast Daylight Saving Time. I just want you to count the hours like I did. So; 6am wake-up time in Northamptonshire is 1am to my body. Get it? Got it? Good.

Wake up at 1am. Driven to Northampton to get the train to London Euston just after 2am. Into Euston at 3am, height of the rush-hour. Tube to Victoria station, train to Gatwick. My flight is at 6.45am, and I arrive with plenty of time to spare. The flight will leave late because it arrived late; there's a storm moving over the Eastern US. The flight takes 7 hours, so I should land in Philly at 3pm. Plenty of time because my connecting flight leaves at 6.55pm.

Coming over New Jersey, we see the thunderheads on the clouds. That storm is still over the Northeastern States. We circle for over an hour but can't land because of the severity of the storm. We have to divert to Baltimore to refuel on the tarmac because the plane will run out otherwise. It's only 20 minutes or so away, but it takes another 45 minutes to refuel. Then we get back in the air, circle some more, and eventually land in what looks like a monsoon.

I'm still OK, because it's not 6pm yet and the connection is at 6.55pm.

Connection cancelled, couldn't make it through the storm so it turned back. Next flight is at 10.45pm, and hopefully the storm will be well over the Atlantic.

Ha!

I change my ticket for the later flight and called my wife to let her know I'll be arriving around 11.45pm. The incoming flight lands late because the storm decides that Philadelphia is a great place to spend a Friday night and just kept on raining. Then all personnel are pulled from baggage duty because the lightning starts up again.

Think about lightning for a second. It goes for the path of least resistance, so it usually strikes the tallest conductor around. An airport needs to be as flat as a billiard table, so the tallest things near an airport departure gate would be the tails of all the wet aircraft outside. If one of them gets struck when someone's pulling luggage out in the wet, they can pretty-much kiss themselves goodbye. It was another 50 minutes before they got the luggage from the previous flight and got the new stuff on.

Now we're waiting for the new first officer. The co-pilot from the incoming flight has left for his next job, and our man is on a flight from Chicago. A flight currently circling PHL, waiting for another break in the storm.

He arrives after midnight. Fortunately, this flight is a Canadair Jet (not one of those Dash turbo-prop things that goes half the speed) so we're up and down in less than half an hour. The storm was passed after five minutes. It stuck like glue to Philly for hours. I eventually got home at 2am Saturday, quickly got ready for bed and fell asleep almost instantly.

That's 25 consecutive hours awake. After two days with a combined eight hours of sleep. 

The flights were fine. The lack of sleep, idiot fucking kids, and a storm that couldn't be helped were the problems. You have a good flight.",t3_1v2wmp,1389653288,3,1/13/14 17:48,1v2wmp

4052,ceo7xtm,t3_1v2wmp,"Hey, op! If you are nervous to fly I'd recommend going to your doctor. Mine prescribed a few pills of lorazepam that i can take when i fly. It seriously helps so much-it just takes the edge off everything! I'd really recommend it.

As for my worst trip story:

I haven't flown since i was 6 (about 20 years ago) and I'm a huge worrier so i was super nervous. And i was flying alone, which only exasperated things, I'm sure. I had taken a trial run of my happy pill at home one day so I'd know what to expect, but since u was just sitting calmly at home eating pizza, i had no idea how long it took to kick in. The day of my flight i took my pill along with my lunch, but, apparently, it should have been earlier.

Since i hadn't flown for 20 years, all of my knowledge of planes comes from TV and movies where planes are big and spacious. I stepped on my plane and it was small, and cramped, and super rickety-looking, and i swear, was straight out of the 1970's. It was just destined to fall apart in the sky. 

Then i get to my seat, which is directly over the engine. So i can see the second the engine explodes everywhere and we start to crash. Also, because the engine was so close, it was really loud. I couldn't hear any of the safety demonstration, and the weird booklet, with its wordless examples of what to do, wasn't helping. 

I was trying to tune this all out, but by time we were on the runway I had tears just streaming down my face. Both the flight attendant next to us and the mom of two small children next to me were very concerned about me. It was awful. 

Luckily, by the time we were descending, my pill kicked in. For awhile, it looked like (totally wasn't actually a threat, just looked like it) our plane was going to land right on the river. By that time it was like, ""oh, we're going to land in the river and die. Ok.""

My husband has been flying since he was very young, so it's all very boring and old news to him. But me, I always tense up when we start moving, and I get so nervous... Especially if we aren't seated together (which happens often, as we are usually the last people to board and you take whatever seat is open).

Despite my fears, I have not had a flight that was troublesome, at least not of any of the crew's doing. In fact, the crew have always been very understanding and comforting.

On one flight, I had contacted conjunctivitis hours before boarding, on top of an also developing cold. The pressure as we lifted off was terrible, and my ears refused to pop. Husband called a flight attendant over, who brought me a warm wet towel for my eyes. I remember trying to nap, but when I woke up, not only was my throat strangle-tight and raw, the pressure in my ears was so bad I began crying. The flight attendant brought me a Sprite and suggested a sort of pressure point, firmly rubbing two fingers in the little nook where your earlobe and jaw connect. It's slowly but surely popped my ears successfully ever since.

The only other unfortunate flight I had placed me in a seat next to a very large woman. Originally there had been no seat available for me, and we never fly separately. But moments after turning us away, we were called back and told a seat had opened up for me. I didn't know how, but I boarded and took the only available seat. With no exaggeration, the lady beside me was so large, some of her was (for lack of a better word) spilling onto my seat. I didn't realize this until she politely murmured, ""Excuse me,"" and pulled her flesh from beneath the edge of my leg. The flight was uncomfortable because of how very aware I was of her large presence, and there was no way to not sit on at least part of her. I was embarrassed that I couldn't make enough room for her, but I was also not trying to draw any awkward attention to her and accidentally insult her by scooting so far off my seat, if that makes any sense.

He used to live in Middle East (Qatar to be exact) and he was flying back to Asia. As you may all know, Middle East draws a lot of planes from different parts of the world. As it turns out, there was a terrible miscommunication between the radio tower and the plane queue.

Just as when my friend's plane was about to take off, (imagine how the engine roars from zero to hero, and how fast they were running) the pilot suddenly stopped. The wings were wriggling like crazy and all of the passengers were confused. Little they did know that there was an oncoming plane going through the intersection that they were about to cross.

I had just had major surgery;
[An appendicitis](http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-appendicitis)

[I had intestinal malrotation as well](http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/digestive/malrotation.html)
So my mom & I board the plane & prior to getting on, I had the feeling of having to throw up, since my intestines had basically been kinked for ~1 month & had been fixed. We had the window seat & the middle seat & kindly asked the guy that I was sitting next to, who was the same height as me if I could have the aisle seat for complicated reasons & he responded, ""No, I have long legs"" & that was that. So we lift off & right as that happens, the people behind me have a baby underneath me that cries the whole 2 hour flight, from Madison to Denver. The drink ladies come by & I get an apple juice for some reason even though I hate apple juice & chug it all. The asshole next to me whips out a huge sub & I ask if he could please put it away until we land & inform him that i'm very nauseous from surgery, he rejects my plea. 5 minutes later, I use the first barf bag i've used & fill it almost to the brim from just apple juice but feel 100% better.

So I was terrified, I hate heights, I have the urge to ""jump"" whenever I get to a certain height and I really don't know why. So here I am, on my first long haul flight and I've given a wing seat, so I can look down and see the tiny little people become dots as I'm stuck inside a flying tin can.

That wasn't the worst part of it however, in the row ahead and in the centre of the plane sat a chap I assume was flying for business but down with us plebs in economy. Nothing wrong with that, after all it's sometimes a good idea to save cash for your business if you can.

The poor chap looked uncomfortable, nervous and clearly wasn't looking forward to this flight. He'd been holding onto his briefcase despite it needing to be stowed in the overhead compartment for take off. 

Then I saw it, ahead was a chap on the end of the left side row of seats staring at him, as if this guy was an alien with two heads. I couldn't figure out his issue until I looked back at the business guy. I could see it now and I felt disgusted by it.

He was of Indian descent and clearly this guy was acting out some post 9/11 bullshit labelling in his head that all folks of a non-white origin were terrorists.

To wrap this up, he verbally berated the cabin crew of letting ""him"" on the plane and demanded he was removed from the flight immediately. The crew of the aircraft instead had him removed and the clearly upset chap upgraded to business as an apology for the distress a now unwelcomed individual had caused.

4081,ceogt49,t3_1v2wmp,"2 stories come to mind on this one. 

1. On the way to Iraq we are on a C-17. I am seated on the left side of the aircraft facing the center. In the middle of the cargo bay, there is a chained down F-15 engine. We go into our combat landing which includes a heavy left bank and losing a lot of altitude quickly. I realize I am laying on my back almost weightless facing this giant thing over to p of me and bouncing around. It seemed like an hour but we finally came out of the approach with no problems. I'll never forget starring at that engine and wondering who chained it, how smart that person is and what is the fail safe.

2. I planned a trip back to the airport in Norfolk, VA. Tropical storm Ida had just got Florida and head up that direction. I checked the weather before we left and wasn't thrilled about what I found. I don't mind flying at all and know what the aircraft are capable of so I wasn't too worried(I fix airplanes and fly very often).  The seatbelt sign goes on with an hour and a half left to go. On a 2 hour flight, that's a bad sign. 20 minutes later the airplane is shaking hard. This continues to the point no one gets served anything by the stewardess. Fast forward to final approach. The aircraft is all over the place and people are screaming and crying. The lady 2 rows up his into a full blown panic attack and stays yelling we are all going to die. I'm joking with the guy next to me with the same sick sense of humor so I'm not too bad off. After 2 or 3 failed attempts we are coming in again and the plane gets way worse. The luggage compartments are opening and bags flying out and hitting people in the head all over the place. Then everything goes completely calm. We come out of the clouds and gently touch down in the softest landing I have ever experienced. Turns out there are 40 mph side wins gusting to 60 and we are the last aircraft landing that day and the only one that tied in the past 2 hours. 

If you are scared of flying, don't think about the terror, think of the happy end results that happen 99.9999% of the time. And that small chance is usually small aircraft that hold less than 20 people.",t3_1v2wmp,1389654729,2,1/13/14 18:12,1v2wmp

I was surrounded by children.  Literally, *surrounded*.  One kid on each side, one full row of kids up front, one full row of kids behind.  No parent, no chaperone.

First they screamed at the top of their lungs into my ears.

Then they attempted to rip out the pages of the book I was reading.

And when they failed at that, they attempted to *tear apart the shirt I was wearing*.

I was coming back from a trip to Rome and Lisbon, and there was a connection flight from Rome to Lisbon then from Lisbon to Rio, it ended up the Rome-Lisbon got late by 10 minutes and we lost the Lisbon-Rio flight, and the next flight was only 23:10(I arrived 14:20). 

Nothing like spending almost the time of the flight on the airport reading books, magazines etc. 8 hours later I go to the gate and decide to buy a tiny chocolate bar in those machines, it was a yummy looking Milka with Oreo, put my money, it gets stuck there aaand I lost my happy little Milka(this also happened to three other dudes who tried to buy something).

But wait! Theres more! When the plane had already taken off in some major ass storm, the plane does like, those quick drops of altitude and everyone goes ""AAAH"" for one second, me personally almost shat my pants, but wait! theres moooore! when the plane was already cruising close to the african coast, near Moroocco(sp?) the plane starts with some massive ass turbulence I don't really recall how much time it was, but it felt it was sooooooo long, I can assure it was longer than one hour.

And lucky me have the jolly luck of having heavy motion sickness, I can't even go 5 stations on the subway without feel weird. And I puked at the plastic bag where the pillow was, I've puked many times before but that one made my chest hurt like a bitch, and I tried to get a little more confortable on the puke... well it worked although after I regurgitated the gorgeous dinner they served I only wanted water and sleep, water I didn't get due to the turbulence, sleep I would only get some loooong after the turbulence ended when we were inside Brazil. We arrived safely though..

TL;DR: Late plane, lost flight home, lost yummy candy, turbulence, puked, lost dinner and my pillow.

We were on a flight from Tokyo to Singapore after having done the 12 hour flight from LA to Tokyo, and were exhausted, hoping to grab a little sleep. At the end of our row (I'm the window, my mother seated in the middle), sits what appears to be a tired Asian businessman but who would soon become my mother's darkest nightmare.

About an hour into the flight, the man removes his suitcase from below his chair--so far two flight attendants have asked him to put it in the overhead bin, which he refused--and brings out what I can only describe as the nasal equivalent of napalm. It scorched my sinus' and smelled abominable to boot. I have a strong stomach so I just laughed it off, but it legitimately made my mother nauseous. I have no idea what it was beyond being some kind of reddish paste with chunks of...something. 

Anyway, thus begins the hours long odyssey of a tormented woman. I go back to reading--even I couldn't sleep with that smell--but my attention is once again captured by the appearance of the captain, who is asking the man *very firmly* to put his suitcase away. The man becomes belligerent, and absolutely refuses. The pilot reminds the man that they have authority to arrest him on the ground in Singapore (a place where if you are carrying drugs or contraband, you *really* don't want to get caught). The man angrily tells the pilot off, and continues to clutch his suitcase tightly. 

By this point, my mother is convinced that he is carrying diamonds, drugs, or something even more illegal (this is pre-9/11 so she wasn't worried about a bomb or something like that). She is hyperventilating and *very* nervous. As a bored 11/12 year old male, I was little help in calming her down, and her sigh of relief as we disembark is audible. 

She still brings it up as a horrific experience, and I still wonder what the hell was in that briefcase. We saw him being taken in for questioning, but I can't help wonder what happened to him.

4 or 5 months post 9/11 I was flying from Boston to Los Angeles. I was an 18 year old girl flying alone. I'm Portuguese and Italian, so white but dark hair/eyes and darker skin than your average Irish American that you see in Boston.

When I got to check in, they pulled me aside and searched my luggage. All of it, right there in front of the other travelers. Everything I had was removed and strewn all over a table. Bras, underwear, clothes, all rifled through. When they were satisfied, I was left to repack it by myself while about 4 TSA agents stared me down.

When I got to the security gate, I got pulled aside. I had to remove my shoes (this was not common at the time) and I got wanded and patted down twice. When they finally let me go on, they went through my backpack just like they had gone through my checked luggage. They opened every item, questioned every item and tried to confiscate my book light.

They finally let me go to the gate, where I only had about 10 minutes left to boarding by this time. I was in one of the last groups called to board the plane. I waited in line, and when I got to the front and handed over my ticket TSA pulled me aside again - at the GATE mind you - and wanded/patted me down again, and searched my backpack again.

I was allowed to board finally, and we made it to wherever my layover was without any more harassment. Until I got OFF the plane... where I was once again pulled aside, wanded, patted down and searched.

I found my way to the gate for my next flight, and as I was boarding that plane (you guessed it) I got taken aside again and had to go through the same search procedure before being allowed to board.

I had no more problems once I got to LA, and had no problems flying home a couple weeks later.

I was ok for the most part waiting for the plane but then the moment they called for boarding a wave of nausea swept over me and I thought I was going to die. It let up somewhat so I figured I would be fine. 

I got on the plane and into my seat and everything was ok until the moment they closed the door and you could no longer get up. The nausea hit so hard I was convinced I was going to vomit right then and there. I have never experienced anything like it. I had a cold sweat,  my stomach was doing  twists and turns and my hands went numb. It was
 the worst experience I've had in many years. I was counting the seconds and half seconds till the fasten seat belt sign went off so I could run to the bathroom to vomit. 

This continued in waves for 30 minutes. And it was completely touch and go. I'd be able to maintain for a time and then the next minute I would be eyeballing the barf bag. 

So finally I hit a tipping point and just couldn't take it. The woman behind me stood up and made a move for the bathroom and looking at her you knew she was the type to be in there a while.  The flight attendant sent her back to her seat because the fasten seat belt sign was still on. When he came by me I stopped him and said I had to go to the bathroom and it was an emergency. He let me go and I bolted for it. 

Now here's the fucked up thing. I tried to vomit. I needed to vomit. But nothing came up. It wasn't that my stomach wasn't full. It just wouldn't happen. And it made me even more sick. I ended up giving up and going back to my seat. The remainder of the flight was absolute torture. Every time I moved an inch or looked out the window a fresh wave would hit me.  

We landed and somehow I survived. I limped off the plane and went straight home and to bed.  Of course the next night I had a night shift and was still not fixed. That was perhaps the most brutal twelve hour shift ever. 

Tl;Dr do NOT fly while hung over. Don't do it. Fly drunk,  never hung over. 

Bonus: I just remembered the flight before this last one that was my worst flight. 

I went to Europe for the first time on a school trip and my buddy said that the trick was to drink half a bottle of nyquil right before you got on and sleep the whole flight. I thought this was a good idea but idiot 17 year old me bought robitussin instead of nyquil. I downed most of the bottle as we got on the plane and what ensued was hellish to say the least. I hallucinated pretty heavily for 4 or 5 hours and was sick to my stomach quite a bit. The girl next to me listened to techno music the whole time and I  had to listen as well.  I just remember wanting to die while there was a constant 4 on the floor beat playing next to my ear. 

Tl;Dr 2: don't drink a bottle of robitussin before getting on a plane to Europe. Don't do it. Get drunk instead. ",t3_1v2wmp,1389634192,1,1/13/14 12:29,1v2wmp

They thought we could still make but the flight would be an 8 hr flight instead of a 5hr one. So we spent the next 5 hrs, flying low over deserted pacific islands, wondering if we'd have enough fuel. Not a lot of alternative airports for a cargo plane in the pacific when you're already flying low at 5,000 ft and 250 knots. Oh and there is no bathroom.

When we got to the airport, everything was going smoothly.  My husband and I were back in economy, his parents were in the premium section (or whatever it is called).  As the plane filled with people, it became apparent that the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working, so it was getting unbearably warm.  


Just as boarding was finishing up, one of the attendants came on the intercom with the dreaded 'If there is a doctor on board please make yourself known to the crew'.  About 5 minutes later an attendant came back to where we were sitting and told us that my FIL had collapsed and my husband needed to go help his mum.


It took about 30 minutes to get my FIL stabilised and off the plane into an ambulance.  After a quick discussion, it was decided that my husband and I would fly home as planned.  There was a further delay while their bags were unloaded, so in total the plane was delayed about an hour and a half.  


While we were dealing with all this, a nearby passenger started getting agitated.  It was stiflingly hot on the plane, so a bit understandable.  However, he then started loudly suggesting that they just chuck my FIL off onto the runway and take off, and that my FIL was an idiot for being ill, etc.  I then had to restrain my husband from attempting to punch the guy, until the flight crew thankfully stepped in and told him to shut up or he would be kicked off.


Once we actually got in the air the flight was fine, but definitely my worse experience on a plane.

Apparently 30 people had been injured, and one guy even broke his neck. I didn't let go of my wife for the remainder of the flight.

4165,cep1haq,t3_1v2wmp,"I'd finished night shift, so I'd been awake since 4pm the previous afternoon, had worked right through the night, and finished that morning at 6am. I had to catch two flights that day, one at 8am, connecting to a flight at 6pm. Plenty of layover time to catch some Z's at the airports. It didn't work out like this however. Throughout the day, it was a clusterfuck of disturbances, mishaps and constant pestering by security and people.

By the time my international 6pm flight rolled around, I'd managed to grab 30 minutes of sleep for the 24 hour period. Having worked a full nightshift the night before, I was completely exhausted. Anyone who works nightshift will know you get to a point throughout the day where you must go to bed. Your circadian rhythms are up the shit, you sweat and your body temp is all over the show, your nose runs and your throat gets sore. 

Fine, whatever. I had a 4 hour flight ahead of me and a nice neck pillow to pass out on. Unfortunately, I was issued a middle seat between two people on a 737-300 (not very roomy, and I'm 6'2"") I normally request an isle seat for a little extra leg room, and easy access to the toilet.

On my left, isle seat, was a lovely older lady who'd showered in old lady perfume, so intense it stung the nostrils, with a couple photo albums who'd just been on a family holiday and wouldn't shut the fuck up. I had no interest in the photos, yet they were continually shoved in my face. I was too polite to decline for a while, until it got the better of me, and I explained my situation about lack of sleep. She was okay with that... for five minutes. As I started to drift off, she struck up small talk with me about life. It was at this point I knew I was fucked. I'd dealt with a few of these people before. The type of person who has gone their whole life without picking up subtle hints, but are easily offended if you're too direct. The ignorance of the situation instantly pissed me off, because she wasn't listening anyway. Just making noise for the sake of it. This carried on for the duration of the flight, with minor breaks in 'conversation'.

On my right, a large gent who liked to drink. And urinate. Every 20 minutes. Because of my height, and his size, every time he wanted out for a piss, I had to get out of my seat and stand in the isle, sit back down, wait for him to come back, get out again - rinse and repeat. 

A few rows behind me. Screaming baby with obvious Eustachian tube blockage. It was making that horrible rapid fire baby scream, non stop. Even a couple seconds of baby scream is enough to make me see red. I don't care what parents say about 'you get used to it, especially if it's your kid' - no. Fuck that. It's easily one of the most horrible noises in the world.

We were flying into NYC and the plane ride was pretty bumpy and we were nearing closer to the airport and I could see the tops of the buildings. So I freak out more, and the flight attendant keeps opening my window.

There are 100s of small changes like moisture on runway,  convection currents from the heat of the ground, wind speed and direction, the flap angle, the load weight being carried, load balance etc that effect how a landing goes. They are all included in the calculation, and 98% of the time it all goes as planned. 1%, you may go past the normal zone on the runway, and 0.99999% of the time you'll touch down on the runway and be carrying too much speed still, so take off again. 

It's not pilot error, and it's not dangerous, it's just that there are so many values that have to be predicted and accounted for that sometimes the first attempt needs to be corrected. You'll find it's particularly common in strong crosswinds. It's probably polite to mention it to the passengers, but it's not compulsory. ",t3_1v2wmp,1389640659,3,1/13/14 14:17,1v2wmp

I was flying home at something early as hell (I had to get up at 3 AM for the usual pre-flight stuff) and we arrived to find that my flight was canceled and the next flight to IAD was at about 1. They rescheduled my flights and I got to get more sleep, so all was fine, but I had to tell a lady of mine we had to reschedule back home. The flight to IAD was pretty normal, run of the mill, drank a ginger ale because I was a little sick. However, when I boarded my next gate to Denver, the flight attendants were weirdly nice to me. On a scale from 1 to 10, they were about an *over 9000*! When I landed in Denver, they gave me all sorts of baked stuff they packed for themselves, but gave to me. I also should mention that I'm flying alone, so flight attendants are usually really nice to me and give me an extra soda/candy or something as a little treat. It's very considerate of them, but I mean these ladies filled my backpack and both hands with treats. We went our separate ways, and I look at the big monitor to see what gate my flight was canceled. I was kinda happy. I like the camaraderie of DIA, but my mom was in tears. I went and got everything corrected with the airline, and I got a flight first thing the next morning to my hometown, as well as 2 meal vouchers and a bunch of those tiny airline blankets. I'm about 5'10"" so it took 3 of those little shits to cover me up. On another note, $10 can buy you a fuckton of Mickey D's if you know how. I was stuffed, not to mention all those sweets I ate. That makes for a fat, dumb, and happy teenager. Next morning, I wake up and I SMELL. I have naturally oily skin and hair, and I haven't showered in two days. I can legitimately slick my hair back, my hair is about 1"" long so this is abnormal for me. I put on my Dodgers cap and slip on my shoes and hope no one notices. All night, my bastard friends link me a bunch of DIA conspiracies and I'm dumb enough to watch them.

>**Gliding flight** is heavier-than-air flight without the use of thrust. It is employed by gliding animals and by aircraft such as gliders. The most common human application of gliding flight is in sport and recreation using aircraft designed for this purpose. However almost all powered aircraft are capable of gliding without engine power. As with sustained flight, gliding generally requires the application of an airfoil, such as the wings on aircraft or birds, or the gliding membrane on gliding possum. However, gliding can be achieved with a flat (uncambered) wing as with a simple paper plane, or even with card-throwing. The term **volplaning** has been used for this mode of flight.

>""**Something**"" is a song by the Beatles, featured on their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was released that same year as a double A-sided single with another track from the album, ""Come Together"". ""Something"" was the first Beatles song written by lead guitarist George Harrison to appear as an A-side, and the only song written by him to top the US charts while he was in the band. The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album.

>John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the band's principal songwriters, both praised ""Something"" as one of the best songs Harrison had written, or that the group had to offer. As well as critical acclaim, the single achieved commercial success, topping the Billboard charts in the United States and making the top five in the United Kingdom. The song has been covered by over 150 artists, making it the second-most covered Beatles song after ""Yesterday"". Artists who have covered the song include Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, James Brown, Shirley Bassey, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams, Ike & Tina Turner, The Miracles, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Isaac Hayes, Julio Iglesias, Mina, and Phish. Harrison is quoted as saying that his favourite version of the song was James Brown's, which he kept in his personal jukebox.

I had decided to splurge on the flight to get back to them sooner rather than wait for the next day to drive down. 

Except the airport was fogbound and they had no radar so planes couldn't land unless they could see the runway. So the circled the airport twice and flew back to Perth. 

I heard a guy ask the stewardess if she could arrange a rental car for him so as soon as we landed I asked him if he would like a passenger.

Then someone recommended SeaBands (if you haven't heard of those, their acupuncture bracelets that put pressure on your wrists) for motion sickness. What I didn't realize was that they help anxiety too!! I tried them last time I flew, and while I can't say I was 100% a happy flier, my anxiety dissipated significantly, and it was an immediate reaction. I'd highly recommend checking those out! Also, lavender helps. I have a perfume roller of lavender and put that on my forehead and nose to calm down. Breathing it in relaxes you.",t3_hvk1qd,1595409386,2,7/22/20 5:16,hvk1qd

""I'll prescribe you a week's worth of Ambien, once your brain gets back into a natural rhythm, you won't need it anymore"". Same with this situation. Even though the Xanax is helping, it's still you conquering your anxiety! It will give you the confidence to not need it in the future.

And hey, even if you do need Xanax every flight, and that's the extent of the life circumstances when you need it (flights), that's ok too!

Think of being on a plane like being on a boat. The only difference is the density of the fluid and the type of force. Water and buoyancy for a boat. Air and lift for a plane. Sometimes it helps thinking about it scientifically. And turbulence? That's just like wake! It's differences in the air pressure. Planes can withstand a good amount of turbulence. 

Keep in mind that large passenger planes have 2 engines. And their wings can sustain forces you couldn't even imagine! They're made so they can bend like 45 degrees before breaking.

Plane travel is actually significantly safer than traveling in a car and you do that without issues!

Those are all my place safety explanations. Hope something helps.

47609,e1rkfqg,t3_8vy6c9,"Wow, I feel like I wrote this post. 

I had flown many times in my life with no issues, even enjoyed flying, and suddenly at age 22 or 23 on a specific flight I had horrible flight anxiety like you described. I just sit there and wait for something horrible to happen. 

It’s not the healthiest route, but I usually try to get a little buzz going at the bar once I’m past security. Just enough to take the edge off. Take-off and mid-flight are my least favorite parts. Landing is totally fine with me, even if we get really bouncy with the ground I am so happy to finally be on the ground. 

I agree with a poster above talking about research. I hate turbulence and it causes a lot of my panic, but it is actually a good thing because it means the plane is reacting how it should! 

Remember that the pilot and attendants also want to get home, too. 

Don’t forget that you can mention to an attendant while you’re boarding that you have flight anxiety and usually they can give you a little extra support during the flight. 

I wear my Beats headphones and blast myself out with music on the flight (but not too loud as to disrespect my neighbors or miss announcements from the captain). Especially during take-off. I like to listen to something fast paced and exciting so I can kind of amp myself up like I’m about to face a challenge. It sounds weird but it helps me a lot! 

I notice that the pilots will usually mention how turbulent the flight will be, listen in at the start to see what they say. Sometimes the coast will be totally clear. 

(Also remember how many flights they do a week! This is routine for them. Think about how nervous people are to go to the gynecologist or proctologist but these doctors see peoples’ private bits every single day.) 

I also saw a therapist and did some exposure therapy at one point, because I was about to attend grad school across the country and I had to accept flying back and forth very often. She had me first write out a narrative of what my biggest nightmare on a flight would be. I also had to write in detail about what I feared on the flight. I had to read these over and over until they were boring. Then I listened to audio and watched video of planes taking off. Over and over until it was boring. Breathing exercises, etc. Then I had a quick 30 minute flight each way for a mini vacation. Had to practice on there. 

When I graduated from grad school and flew home, I cried on the flight during some turbulence towards the end of the flight and ended up making friends with the man next to me. He was sweet and held my hand and reassured me that everything was okay until we landed. He was actually a firefighter that jumps out of helicopters to save people, so it gave me a lot of perspective. (Thank you Mike, if you’re reading!!)

Obviously you don’t have time to see a therapist before this flight, but I would recommend one when you are able! 

Some flights go better than others. Just take it one step at a time. <3

Good luck!

47610,e1ram8m,t3_8vy6c9,"Hi there. I've spent the past 5 years getting over my fear of flying (and this was after spending a good 30 years flying without issue). I did a lot of research like you (listening to podcasts from pilots, watching YouTube documentaries, reading etc...) and it all helped to some degree. But what I found really helped was:

* Asking myself what was it about flying that freaked me out. In my case, I wasn't so worried about hijacks, I was a little worried about the wings falling off (watching a YouTube documentary where they stress tested an aeroplane wing fixed that) but I was really worried that turbulence would knock us out of the sky. So I did research directed at that.
* Actually getting on aeroplanes. In therapy I believe it's called ""Exposure Therapy"". Of course, flying is pricey so I couldn't fly very often but when I could I really tried to remember what I had learned.

The biggest ""ah ha!"" moment for me came very recently in February. I was on a flight to Tokyo and the plane started to taxi. And it's difficult for me to put it into words what it is I actually got but it felt like all my research and exposure came together and ""clicked"". For the first time in 5 years I was able to enjoy my flight to Tokyo and back.

Xanax did help. Also, calming music. Aisle seat if possible, so you feel less ""trapped"".

I also found that instead of feeling like ""I *have* to fly"", I tried to think ""I *get* to fly"". It sounds silly, but during one flight I noticed the coffee pot built into the plane. And I began to marvel at the fact that this machine can cross the country in 4-5 hours, has wifi, has coffee, etc. And I realized that it's a privilege to be able to experience that. 

Making a deliberate effort to feel gratitude instead of fear and anxiety really helped turn things around for me as far as flying goes. Back in Jan, I flew from AZ to MA and had like 1/2 of a Xanax on the way there. I used to take one on the way to the airport (I wasn't driving), one while waiting to board, and one on the plane.

On the way back from MA to AZ, it was the first time I flew in many many years with no Xanax at all. ",t3_b553jt,1553510753,1,3/25/19 6:45,b553jt

47633,ejcj6o8,t1_ejc85m6,"I was initially prescribed the Xanax to take as needed. Flights certainly qualified. But the ""as needed"" events were kind of frequent. Not an abuse thing, but I found that at a particular point in my life, I was putting myself into a lot of anxiety-inducing situations. In a good way.. pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

My psychiatrist let me know that if I felt that I needed the Xanax that often, she wanted to prescribe Celexa (Citalopram) as a once-a-day anxiety medication. I'd still have the Xanax for the occasional situations. But I made a conscious effort to take the Xanax less frequently and started on the Celexa. 

I'm a big fan of the Celexa. I don't want to potentially break any sub rules, so I'll just say that it worked well *for me*.

47650,eik8gz5,t3_b13zfr,"I have similar feelings about flying and here are some things that have helped me in the past: 

I try to have a snack with me that I can eat slowly throughout the whole flight, like a bag a pretzels. I read once that eating or drinking can help to counteract your fight-or-flight response that is heightened during a panic attack. In the classic fight-or-flight example of a human running from or attacking a predator, the human wouldn't just stop to eat an apple in the middle of this if things were really that dangerous, so by chewing, your brain is signaled that things are okay. Also just the act of eating helps distract me from my anxious feelings. Just really focus on the sensations of chewing. Notice the salt crystals on the pretzels, feel the crumb structure, etc. 

I also try not to look around very much. I focus on a book or something in my hands. It helps me not think about the whole, tiny-plane-with-no-way-out, thing. I usually pick an aisle seat, too, to help with the ""trapped"" feeling of being against the window wall or in the middle of two people. 

If it is an option and something that you enjoy, try exercising before your flight. If I go for a run before a high-anxiety situation, it tires me out and helps burn off some of my nervous energy. Then I would see the flight as an opportunity to just sit and recuperate for a few hours. 

If it is calming for you, try listening to music or an audiobook. If I can get really absorbed in the story, it helps me not think too much about being on a plane. 

It may seem counterintuitive, but remember the panic attack you had on your flight last week. Remember that while it was really unpleasant, you got through it. You calmed yourself down and came out of it. While it may seem like a setback, every panic attack is an opportunity to prove to yourself that panic is just a feeling and can't actually hurt you, and you can overcome it.

I have an absolute phobia of myself or anyone I love flying any distance any where any time. Unfortunately my little sister goes to college in North Carolina (we live in California) and she has to fly to come home/go back and any time anyone in my family wants to visit they have to fly there/back etc. obviously. 

My family knows about my anxiety issues and all of my triggers including and beyond flying and they've been extremely extremely supportive of it. My parents and grandparents whom I'm extremely close to just left on a flight yesterday morning to North Carolina to visit my sister and I was terrified the entire time. I made sure to hang out with my parents the entire day beforehand and say really long extravagant goodbyes before I left because it's something that really helps me (my phobia stems basically from me losing one/all of them without getting to say goodbye I love you etc.) and I made my mom FaceTime me right before she was about to get on the plane and right when she landed. It also helped me to add her on Snapchat so she can send me little updates from the plane that everything is going fine they're having fun and all that. Since Snapchat is an app it won't interfere with the plane radios or anything as long as you're connected to the plane wifi. Keeping in communication has been really really essential and I'm planning on doing this again when they leave to come home on Sunday. I know it may seem dramatic, but it has really helped and could also possibly help you in your situation. Sorry for the extremely long winded response. ",t3_5zh7fb,1489582698,1,3/15/17 8:58,5zh7fb

You will probably get a lot of answers, but this is the only one you will get from an authority on the subject. As both an airline captain and a licensed therapist, I have specialized in treating flight phobia for many years. 

Panic disorder is an awful problem to deal with on a plane. You have no way to get relief through escape. Xanax? It may help, but it may do the opposite. I don't hear from people Xanax works for. I hear from those who it does't work for. Fortunately, I can give them a way to control panic - both in flight AND on the ground.

If you did not have panic disorder, I would suggest you just get my free app at http://www.fearofflying.com/app but it will take more than that. If you are a good student, my book will help: ""SOAR: The Breakthrough Treatment for Fear of Flying. You can sample it at http://a.co/0n0P5v2

Thankfully a few things went my way 1. Empty planes and 2. No air sicknesses. I made sure to bring my headphones, iPod and phone to ensure I could have lots of music to drown any sounds. I had Benadryl with me in case anxiety and nausea became too much for me. 
I am a long time emetophobe, so I am right there with you. Getting sick isn't an option. That also goes for the people around me, I'm gonna run if anyone so much as mentions it. As of right now though? I couldn't imagine setting foot on a plane. I had a daughter 16 months ago and I never knew anxiety could take such a fucked up turn. I'm constantly nauseous every single day. I've had almost all the testing done with no answers. This phobia is taking over me and I can't figure out how to reverse it like I used to. 
My best advice is to bring lots of distractions or anxiety meds if you use them [which I just saw that you do]. Music, good headphones, interesting things to read. Depending on the length of your flight, you could get a good nap in. And stop reading horror stories! That's what I do and it makes everything so much worse. Best of luck to you.

My suggestion? It might be worth getting some medication. I know that some people are deathly afraid of flying and they take something like Xanax right before they board the plane. It's not the best solution, but it works.

Another option is to find something that you know will distract you well. It sounds like reading and watching TV doesn't do much to completely distract you. I like doing mind-intensive things, like Sudoku and other puzzles. Basically, the idea is to put all your energy and focus into one thing so that you completely distract yourself from your anxiety.

But for us...we skew the odds.  Its probably not reassuring but the one thing that really turned my fear around was having a major freakout on a plane.  Suddenly feeling like a big idiot in front of tons of people and having the air crew treat you like a special case really put into perspective how normal and routine air travel is and that the problem was with ME, not with planes.

Acquire a grounding device. 

This could be anything small. A trinket. Something which you can hold to remind yourself of what is important. Personally, I use a scent bottle. I purchased a simple bottle of salt oils and other smells. Because smell is so powerful in the amygdala and our memories/emotions. If you are not going the smell route it is nearly essential you come up with a mantra to associate with the trinket. Such as ""I am safe and I am real."" or ""I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this."" This helps ensure you have a more conscious and connected response to the physical object. You are attempting to affix an association of strength and calm onto the trinket. With smell it is a bit easier, but you can also have a mantra with that as well. I did not need a mantra with mine. 

I know you only have a week but hear me out. You are going to apply pavlovian psychology to yourself. 

Two ways you can use it. 

1. Every time you feel confident, powerful, calm, real, smell the thing or pick up the thing and recite your mantra. 
2. NEVER pick it up and recite your mantra when you are afraid. 

You must first associate the correct emotion with the trinket. 

Then when you get on the plane and you feel frightened, use the trinket as the grounding tool it is. 

The second way you can use it is because of your short time to prepare. 

1. Write down all the things you think of when you become afraid to fly. Write down all the fears, the anxieties.
2. On the other half of the page write down the solutions to each of those fears. The logic you could use to convince yourself to be less afraid. 
3. Try your best to bring yourself to a calm place. IF you must, come back to the paper later when you are feeling okay. 
4. Then read only the calming logic and hold/use your trinket. And recite your mantra. 


DPDR is essentially a saftey mechanism for extreme or persistent anxiety, fear. DPDR could come back if you become extremely anxious again. But this dissociation is used to try and protect you from something. The challenge is to try and convince your brain you are safe, there is nothing to fear, therefore nothing to protect yourself from. 

And while you could claim there is potential harm around every corner, the next step is to find enough inner strength to withstand the tests of life. Work hard. Life can change. ",t3_b9a662,1554419162,1,4/4/19 19:06,b9a662

53652,eq8axen,t1_epwguw6,"So, don't think that I forgot about you but I just wanted to make sure I refreshed my software safety skills before answering you.

Software is a very tricky subject when it comes to safety because of two main aspects.  The first are bugs in the code itself.  This is normally what people think about when they have a fear of software in control of an aircraft. This is what we would consider as a failure of the software itself.  Luckily, this actually simple to prevent. It's very time consuming and labor intensive though so depending on how critical the software is a full check will get done. This check includes:

-	checking the software runs under ideal conditions (all inputs normal)
-	 checking the software runs under worst case conditions (inputs failed/erroneously high, low or oscillating)
-	 checking bitwise operations of the software This one is a bit tougher to understand but that's kind of what happened under qantas.
-	checking that even if the software runs normally , if it starts in a random portion of the code or jumps around due to some interference it won't fail the system

All of these checks are done for flight critical systems. 

The second type of failure is actually a hot topic in system Safety right now which is leading towards it being implemented in new designs. This failure involves the software and system working normally but some sort of operation within the system is unsafe.  In the past, we relied on humans to handle ""random and unforseen events"". This meant we could just focus on mechanical pieces that could break.  We could trust that a pilot, or Air traffic controller would know the correct response to mitigate a disaster. So, the ERJ 175 probably subscribes to that same philosophy. Lucky for you, pilots have been flying it for years safely so it has experienced thousands of events that safety engineers like me would never have expected and yet it continues on. 

And my gut feeling is pretty accurate. Look at this chart [here.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/28/plane-crash-nepal-safety#data) The ERJ might be a small number of the total fleet but it is still incredibly safe.

Twin engine airplanes all have at least double the power they need (they wouldn't be legal to fly otherwise), and no airline is going to waste fuel using all that power when they don't need to. If you've ever watched airplanes take off at an airport, you'll notice that regardless of size, they all lift off at approximately the same spot on the runway. Of course there can be exceptions here and there for one reason or another, but airlines will generally use the lowest power setting they need for a safe takeoff. That saves both fuel and wear and tear on the engines.

This is all calculated by the dispatchers in advance based on the runway length, airplane weight and weather, and then programmed into the flight management system ahead of the takeoff by the pilots. They don't then even directly control the amount of thrust; the FADEC does, which is a computer similar to the one in your car that determines how much gas to actually give the engine when you step on the gas pedal. The pilots will just put the throttles in the takeoff position and the FADEC decides how much thrust to give based on all those calculations.

On the same day, in the same conditions and at the same airport, a 737-800 and A320 will use pretty much exactly the same runway length and take off in a very similar amount of time, because that's what's been calculated for best efficiency.

53686,fe6f180,t3_enl7zl,"A fast descent is almost never a pilot's choice. Unless there's an emergency, the pilot is always following instructions from somewhere. These can include:

1) The dispatcher, who calculates things like optimal fuel burn and provides pilots with instructions on how to set up their flight management systems that actually plan the flight in the aircraft.

2) The FMS itself, which calculates the actual flight path. (Of course a pilot can override this if necessary, but it usually isn't, and that also brings up #3.)

3) ATC, whose instructions are binding.

4) Published arrival and approach charts.

Most often, airliners follow a flight path, including descent, that was pre-determined before the plane ever took off. Obviously sometimes things do come up and ATC needs to make changes to the expected flight path. But except in very specific cases, there's no reason why a pilot would actually want to delay descent and then have to hurry to get down - it's a lot more difficult to do that.

The only exception I can think of is in icing conditions, when pilots do sometimes wait until they can make a fast descent through the icing area. That's for your safety, so the plane picks up less ice. But this is less common in large airliners (it's more common in props) and you would probably know if icing conditions like that existed; you'd be flying through a lot of clouds and would likely see some sort of precipitation as you went through them.

Some airports also require very steep drops to land due to surrounding buildings or terrain (San Diego, where I live, is one of those). Pilots in modern commercial jets actually do very little in terms of manually flying the aircraft, unless there is a special reason or emergency situation. Most flying (including descent, approach, and landing) is quite automated. Essentially they plug information in to the flight computer and autopilot takes care of everything else. When coming into an airport, there are transmitters that feed info via radio waves to the flight computer. That information includes runway location and altitude, glide slope, and some other information. The computer then makes the correct changes to thrust, control surfaces (excluding rudder), and altitude to basically land the aircraft without intervention. The only thing the pilots really do is engage flaps at necessary intervals and apply braking once the aircraft touches down (again, unless there is inclement weather or some other irregular circumstance). This is of course a simplification, and professional pilots please chime in, and add or correct anything I got incorrect.

Although it is uncomfortable and sometimes abrupt bouncing the aircraft is safe, under control, and not going to fall out of the sky. 

Without getting into the weeds the aircraft is designed to take these stresses in flight and in turbulence is flown at a safe speed that protects the structure no matter how rough the air is. 

The ups and downs are a result of uneven air(think uneven road like rocks) the wing is flying(driving) over. There’s rocks that push up and rocks that push down. Sometimes the only one wing gets pushed up which is why you sometimes experience a brief turning sensation during turbulence. 

In many cases as pilots we go with the flow to a certain extent as a brief up results in a down shortly after and fighting it is uncomfortable and sometimes impossible which is why sometimes you feel like you go up or down for a bit. 

As pilots we hate turbulence as much as you, we try to find smoother air(air that’s not disturbed like the bumpy road) but depending on the weather systems there may or not be better air to be had.

54213,fcbha86,t3_egyqsz,"I feel for you. My wife suffered from pretty severe panic attacks and they were not easy to overcome. Therapy helped her significantly. 

Several years ago I got motion sick as a passenger on an airline flight. The flight was not turbulent, but because the Captain mentioned Lt. Col so and so would be flying the night leg, I found myself paying extremely close attention to every climb, descent, and power change. I assumed the FO was on IOE, and I wanted to see if I could notice a difference in a mil guy flying. My interest and excitement turned to queasiness, and I began to wonder if this guy knew how to fly. It felt like we were climbing and descending the entire flight (50 mins). I became very anxious about both his ability and vomiting in general. I had never experienced motion sickness or anxiety before and I didn’t understand it. We finally landed (no vomit) and I mentioned to a fellow passenger that it was the worst flight ever, and they seemed surprised. I knew it was a ‘me’ issue. 

For several commercial flights after that, I usually required a distracting movie on my iPad so I wouldn’t feel a tinge of anxiety. Eventually I realized the motion never bothered me since the slightest distraction would negate everything. What bothered me was worrying that I might get motion sick. The anticipation was causing anxious feelings. Overtime, I got used to the sensations and gradually used the iPad less and less. My wife also reminded me to accept anxious feelings as a simple emotion and to not try to control them, as that would lead to an anxious worrying spiral. At times I would tell myself “this seemingly sharp, abrupt bank makes me nervous, but that’s ok and it’ll pass”. Anxiety is worrying about things that almost never come true, and that sure is a waste of time and energy.

When I decided to get back into GA, I felt some of the same anxious feelings during preflight and steep turns, but I just kept reminding myself they were just dumb tricks my mind was playing on me, and I completed the flights fine. I had to get kinda angry with myself and say “Fuck off brain!”, I’m doing this no matter what happens and push through. Go up with a CFI and get used to the altitudes etc. 

I never read the book, but in my research on other aviation forums, several guys mentioned Don’t Panic by Reid Wilson. Also, I came across a post by a 20 yr professional pilot suddenly experiencing panic above 7kft. He later had a panic attack driving somewhere and ended up tracing the root of the anxiety to other non flying stress in his life. Maybe something else is stressing you and it’s manifesting while flying. 

Lastly, anxiety happens to all types of pilots. You’re not defective. The U2 pilot candidates have to try on the space suit as part of the weeding out process. Some really experienced guys feel claustrophobic and drop out on the spot and go back to their fighters etc. The dude from Pilot To Pilot admitted feeling anxious on commercial jets after an engine failure in a C206. He pushed through and is now flying Citations.

This may be caused/aggravated by mild hypoxia.   It should improve after 4-6 weeks of living at high altitude, but for some medical reason, your body may not have adapted.  Ask your doctor to take a blood test to see if you have a lower Red Blood Count RBC than what would be expected for most people living at your altitude.  Possible causes of low RBC would be a B-12 deficiency and that is easy to fix.

>I’m scared of the mountains. I’m alright in the valley but the thought of going on cross countries over (way too high for comfort at all) or through the mountains just freaks me out. 

That fear is rational especially in ASEL.  Learn to transform your fear into vigilance.  If you're going to fly in the mountains, you have to make peace with the heightened risk.   A therapist or a minister can help you to come to terms with the reality of your own eventual death.  Fear of death is at the root cause of a lot of neurotic acting out, but people learn how to accept that it is inevitable and then they're a lot happier.

If its a worry about something going wrong, go with an instructor and do some simulated emergencies.  Or hop in a sim and run them “for real”  In a single piston, fire is really theeee only risk.  And that’ll be from either the engine, or electronics.  Shut off the power, close the fuel valve and you have a good chance of the fire snuffing out.  Anyyyy other issues, are basically inconveniences, especially if you’re just bombing around day VFR.  When you’re in the sim or with an instructor, get them to fail some stuff.  See how the plane behaves.  See how you behave.   I think a lot of peoples fears come from the what ifs.  So, make the what ifs a reality (while its safe) and see what happens.",t3_egyqsz,1577613652,3,12/29/19 5:00,egyqsz

54222,fccw3ev,t3_egyqsz,"When I was a kid in the late 90s I had to fly on a small south west, twin prop puddle jumper once a month to go see my dad. I loved flying and even though I was always nervous about the plane crashing or something I was fine once we got going. There was nothing more relaxing than a night flight in my own seat with twin props drowning everything out and putting me into a sort of white noise coma. 

Fast forward to 2008 and I hadn't flown in years, not since  9/11. First flight in ages and I was more nervous than I'd ever been. Even though flying was a beautiful thing I loved, I couldn't get over the loss of control. It upset me that I couldn't enjoy it anymore. It wasn't 9/11 fears either. I was just terrified of being up in the plane and I felt claustrophobic. I had no control and no way out. My life was in someone else's hands and if something went wrong there was nothing I could do to stop it. If we crashed I'd just be a number on the news. Awful stuff. Analyzing it though it makes sense. At that time in my life I felt like I had no control over anything. Things weren't going the way they should and I felt trapped, desperate for a way to change things. I was afraid of getting stuck in life. I was afraid of dying having not accomplished anything yet. So if something happened to the plane I'd be dead, my life would have had no meaning and there's nothing I could have done to stop it. 

I'm saying all this to suggest that maybe something changed in your life. The reason could be subconscious. The things that affect us aren't always readily apparent.

54226,fcm8cpk,t3_egyqsz,"On my second cross country during my PPL training I was cruising at 8500msl and I had a panic attack and immediately descended and diverted to a nearby airport to calm myself. I felt trapped in the airplane and experienced a lot of the same symptoms you describe. I took a week off and went back to finish my training since I was so close but I was sure I would never be comfortable in an airplane again. 

That was 1.5 years ago. I posted here asking for advice just like you and everyone told me I needed to talk to a therapist but I didn’t want to go down that road as I’m not much of a “talk about my problems” kinda guy. Somebody suggested I keep flying and that it would come to pass...Well, I just recently completed my IFR rating. I’m still not completely comfortable but there have been days where I thought I was cured only to “freak out” on later flights. I just tell myself that I am in control and that it’s all in my head and to calm down and I’m usually fine after a couple of minutes...sometimes physically “shaking it out” helps. Talking helps if you have someone to talk to, if not, try reading something out loud like a checklist or talk to yourself.

If I feel it coming on I try to not think about it. I find that acknowledging the fear or whatever it is only makes it worse because you are giving it more power.

Good luck hope it helps!

Edit 1: I get totally antsy in the cruise mostly because I’m bored and not focused on anything in particular...maybe add more waypoints to your flight plan so you don’t have much time between points and you can constantly focus on keeping track of your flight plan and looking for your points on your route.",t3_egyqsz,1577795740,1,12/31/19 7:35,egyqsz

54319,dch6us1,t3_5o6mjl,"There's some merit to the idea of conquering her fear of flying through exposure, but a therapist will gradually expose the patient to slowly increasing stimuli over the course of many weeks. For instance, the first few sessions might only involve looking at pictures of planes, or asking the person to imagine being in a plane (incidentally, this is why therapists are so jazzed about VR). This progression is also paired with coaching on breathing + meditation techniques and general CBT to help with anxiety. Just exposing someone to an extreme version of their fear will probably traumatize them. For an example of this approach not working, review the history of MJ's failed exposure therapy (e. g. https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/2qadz3/facing_her_fear_of_flying_part_2_do_yall_remember/). The part 2 involves a simulator rather than a real flight, and it goes much better. 

I'd get more information from your acquaintance. If she has a serious phobia and hopes flying with you will cure it, everyone will be disappointed. If she is sort of scared of flying but also thinks it will be cool and wants to try it, that's a different story. When flying with people who fear planes, here are some things that have worked for me:

* Surprises are bad. Brief the flight with her in detail: what's the weather, what's the plan, what are your plan b's. Lay out in layperson terms everything you thought through as you planned the flight and made a go-no go decision. Then, during the flight, point out every instance of reality matching your plan. If reality doesn't match your plan, point out the deviation and explain what it means. Obviously, this narration is workload permitting.
* Remember that your comfort level and her comfort level may be quite different. Having just gotten your license, you probably feel comfortable doing a power off 180 landing and then losing 200 ft on short final with a forward slip. As a newly minted pilot, if you hear the tower controller say ""N1234, can you accept a short approach?"" you might normally eagerly accept. With your acquaintance, however, you should definitely decline to avoid traumatizing her. She won't be impressed; just scared.
* Learn the highlights of the Nall report. Local news loves to highlight every little aviation dustup, so most people have a sense that little planes crash all the time but don't know that only comprises a minuscule fraction of all GA flights. Being able to quickly challenge statements along the lines of ""But isn't is super dangerous?"" or ""I heard about this one plane that crashed an everyone died"" with quickly reply with Nall report highlights usually shuts that down.
* Let the passenger ask questions on the ground. Usually, people want to ask about different emergencies. For the survivable ones, talk about how you will survive it. I like to emphasize the many resources at our disposal: training, backup systems, ATC, other planes. For the non-survivable emergencies (e. g. in-flight breakup), I explain why it won't happen. Just don't say, ""My family gets a giant insurance payout"". Passengers don't seem to like that answer.
* Fly in conditions vastly below your personal minimums. Light-to-no winds, clear skies, short flight, familiar plane, familiar route, similar W&B. You need to monitor her throughout the flight and keep her updated on how things are going. That will require some level of effort on your part. The less effort required for your PIC duties, the more you can devote to keeping her happy.

Please let us know whether you decide to do the flight, and how it goes if you do. I'm always looking for better ways of dealing with flying fraidy cats. ",t3_5o6mjl,1484555353,15,1/16/17 3:29,5o6mjl

When you do get to the airport have her join you for the walk around so see can see that everything is good to go and you aren't taking a bucket of bolts held together by duct tape in the air.    
  

I found that talking through everything helps calm the nervous pax calm down, if they know why you are doing what and there is a method to your madness it really helps them.

  After you are in the air have fun, keep everything nice and gentle and focus on the cool stuff to see outside the plane. I'd caution you to read at least the summary of this [NTSB report](https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001212X18632&key=1), it should help.

Here's why:

* she's already a bit nervous going on a first date, don't throw a small airplane into it

* a lot of things can go wrong MX/WX that can screw up the night and then you're scrambling for plan B

* it's really hard to follow that up, the bar is set pretty high

54324,dch3ep2,t3_5o6mjl,"To quote myself from another thread where a guy wanted to take his nervous girlfriend flying. 


>Keep it short. 30 min is ideal.
Brief her heavily on what to expect; sounds, vibrations, what your going to do during the flight. For the love of God, Do Not surprise her! Do not say we're going to do a sightseeing trip over the town, but then take her on a Surprise date for a $100 hamburger. Leave the romantic surprises for when she's comfortable. And brief her at home. The night before were she's comfortable. Don't tell her the plan in the car, or at the airport.
In the plane, give her a task to do. Something that doesn't really matter, but gives her some sense of control. Ask her to keep a timer going and report every 15 mins to help back you up for ~some reason~. People who fear flying tend to feel powerless. Giving them some small job tends to help them feel in control.
Anyways, I posted this in another thread, for a guy who was bringing his girlfriend up, some of it may apply to you, so I'll copy and paste it here;


>Periodically ask how she's feeling on a scale of 0-100 if they say ""99!,"" it's time to end the flight. The path from 99% to vomiting and never wanting to fly with you again happens breathtakingly fast. The goal is to end the flight with them still excited and wishing it wasn't over yet, asking you to please keep going! If you can't end it with that sort of enthusiasm, they will want to fly again. If they get remotely sick, or start to feel scared/uncomfortable/bored, then you've ruined aviation for them.

>As pilots, we tend to take this for granted. After all, we all wanted to fly sense the first time we saw a contrial, right? Non pilots are different. If you want them to share your passion, you have to hook them. Leave them wanting more. Never let them feel anything less then 100%.

>Unless your girlfriend is a huge roller coaster junkie, don't do any stalls, steep turns, slow flight, etc. you know what, even if she is save that jazz for flight number two, so she has something to look forward too.

>As other people have suggested, take them sightseeing, ideally to another airport restaurant. Try to and it some place close, 30 mins flight is probably tops.

>If your super lucky, and you can fallow a major road or river over something interesting to see do that. People like a sense of control. If they know the insterestate or river your following, they vagely know what direction they are going and tend to feel more comfortable. Up to the two of you if your going to let her fly. If you are thinking about it I'd suggest discussing it at home. Don't suppose her by passing controls to her. People get overwhelmed by that pressure fast. As pilots, we tend to be shocked by this, to most of us it's hard to fathom Somone not wanting to fly! ;)

>Anyways, As someone who used to do a lot of discovery flights and sight seeing flights, and an airplane owner who loves to take my friends up with me, these are some of what I learned through some painful trial and error over many years.

54326,dchv6z7,t3_5o6mjl,"Here you have pilot (me) who has an irrational fear of flying. It took me a long time to figure it out, but as it happens my fear is not flying, but rather a fear of not being in control. Now its completely obvious to me, I hate being a passenger period! I just never realised. Stick me in the back seat of a passenger jet these days and I am ok. Stick me right seat next to a PPL in a 4 seater GA plane and I spend my time in sheer terror!

The key to understanding fear, is to isolate what the actual fear is. Its completely natural to have fears, its an evolutionary trait that keeps us alive. The problem is sometimes the fear of something becomes excessive and it takes time to deal with that.

My suggestion would be to take a small flight (pack a sick bag). You will know if there is a problem on departure and you can easily turn back and land if needed. You also need to keep in constant communication, if you sense a problem then head home. I now use the /u/Schteevie method (I think it was his video) of asking a passenger to rate their level of comfort on a scale of 1-10.

Also, you know your local area (or should do), so warn passengers when you expect some mechanical turbulence, or if you fly under a darker cloud. Let them know when to expects some bumps, even if they are nothing to you. I even let passengers know if I am feeling uncomfortable with a particular situation that will require some action. ie, I fly out of an airport that has nasty crosswinds half of the year, and sometimes a gust will catch you unaware and you need to go around. Communication goes a long way.

Recognize, as I hope you do, that your fear isn't rational.  You're more likely to have a car accident on the way there than to have even a minor incident on the plane.

The thing that I'm really stuck on is that you've *never been on a plane*.  I'd suggest fixing that.  Find a local flight school (google ""flight school <your city name here>"") and ask for a discovery flight.  It'll be weird - new experience and all that.  But if you go in with the idea that you might actually be okay, the outcome is far more likely to be successful.

I think that it's caused by how easy it is to imagine an air disaster, even though air disasters are ridiculously unlikely. To someone who has many many experiences with safe flying, the thought of ""going for a ride in an airplane"" brings up memories of uneventful flights (other than for maybe some turbulence here and there, and the annoyances of delays and lost bags), rather than scary imagined visions of nearly impossible accidents.

So the best ""cure"" that I can recommend is trying to expose someone to the idea that there are lots and lots and lots of safe flights going on all the time.

Here is one other thing you can try. Look at a watch with a second hand. Say ""Landing"". Wait three seconds. Say ""Landing"" again. Three more seconds. ""Landing"". Three more. ""Landing"". Keep this up for as long as you can, and when you have to go do other things in your day, keep in in your head: ""Landing, 1, 2, Landing, 1, 2, Landing, 1, 2, Landing"".

A commercial flight lands safely every 3 seconds in the US. That's **on average** (i.e. even more during the day, fewer at night). Try to wrap your mind around the unfathomable number of safe commercial flights that happen in the US every year, every month, every day, every hour. It's a LOT.

You are going to have to decide if your fear of flying is greater than your desire to take your son on an amazing trip.

I can assure you that it is safe.  The pilot flying the plane has trained at least 1500 hours just to sit in the seat to be able to take you where you want to go.  They most likely have trained more.  If there is any question as to the status of the airplane they won't even leave the gate.

A couple of interesting numbers to keep in mind:

The Malaysian 777 crash (or hijacking or theft or whatever it was, who knows) was 52 days ago. In that period, there have been about **four and a half million flights** (including a million and a half commercial flights) in the United States alone, more than twice that in the whole world. You never hear about the 90,000 flights that land safely every day in the US, you just hear about the one that doesn't, once every...

Once every how often? Well, there were no jetliner fatalities in the US between November of 2001 and the Asiana 777 at SFO last summer. That's **a twelve-year streak with zero fatalities**. So hopefully we will go another 11 or 12 years without seeing another jetliner fatality in the US. Let's check back in 2025, and maybe by then, a single other jetliner in the US may have killed someone (but quite possibly none).

Notice that only 2 or 3 people died in SFO that day last summer, on an airplane that carries 200-300 people. That is fairly typical for a lot of hull-loss accidents lately, such as [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_38), [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549), [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_358), [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20120101023153/http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/gerona.html), [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_1420), [this one](http://avherald.com/h?article=4407f71a), [this one](http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/2010-08-18-miracle18_ST_N.htm), etc. These all look horrific, but no one died (except for the ones that took place outside the US and/or more than 15 years ago).

The same thing applies here. As pilots, students, ATC, and enthusiasts alike, we know well the irrationality of fearing flight. To someone who is not us, not an ""expert,"" though, the entire thing might as well be voodoo. 

Moreover, it's an overly simplistic approach to something that to others may be quite vexing. /u/pittguy578 should most certainly take the flight and ""get over it,"" but simply saying that without making any attempt to understand his perspective is misguided and accomplishes nothing.

However, one should not be so quick to dismiss simplistic approaches to overcoming fear.

For example, I will say too many a time i'd have students who were terrified of stalls, or some other ""violent"" (ha!) maneuver. I'd gently walk them through and hold their hands bla bla bla they'd start freaking out and getting tense. OK, so that's not working out (*because that's what every guy before me did to them*)

So, then at some point, I'd tell my students to look straight at me, and to not dare look away. I'd then do a pretty violent (for their standards anyways) power on stall without waring, usually resulting in a squealing student. However, upon watching me being completely calm about it, the squealing would quickly subside. Then, I'd let them try doing one of those stalls on their own. More often than not, after their first try, not only did they not squeal, they did the maneuver like a freaking boss.

54435,chlzg4m,t3_25xg58,"sentrysafe was rude, but to the point.

You flew in turbulence.  That's all there is to it.  Chop is nothing unusual.  Pilots fly through it every day.  It's so completely routine to them that they pretty much tune it out completely.  The extent that they care about it is pretty much confined to their passengers' comfort exclusively, and even then, the only thing they can do is *try* to avoid it.  Once you're in it, even the most skilled pilot cannot do much to make the flight any less bumpy.  So don't blame the guys up front.

Turbulence has nothing to do with the age of the aircraft.  You will feel the exact same sensations and hear the same sounds with a brand new shiny plane straight off the assembly line.  The only difference will be your feeling of perceived danger, that you think the possibility exists that a wing might come off or something important might fall off and cause you to crash.  

And the reason you thing those things is, frankly, because you know nothing about how airplanes are designed, built, and maintained.  If you did, then you might know a little something about the statistics of how many aircraft fall apart in the sky due to strong turbulence each year: zero. Never in the history of commercial aviation has anything happened like what you imagine in your mind's eye. 

Yes, there have been disasters due to improper maintenance.  Nothing to do with turbulence; they can, and often have, happened in perfectly calm air.  And by the other token, there have been serious landing and takeoff mishaps caused by bad turbulence, but they have nothing to do with the age of the plane; pilots can, and often have, stuff up just as badly in a brand new plane as they can in an old one.

Don't judge a plane's airworthiness by its entertainment or interior lighting systems.  Those things are on completely isolated subsystems from the airplane's avionics, built to completely different standards, and maintained on a completely different schedule.  No company will ground a plane because the in-flight movie screens are glitchy; they *will* absolutely ground a plane if there is even a slight problem in the engines or flight control systems.

>__[Delta Air Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines) Flight 191__ was a regularly scheduled service from [Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale-Hollywood_International_Airport), Florida to [Los Angeles International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport), California, by way of [Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth_International_Airport). On the afternoon of August 2, 1985, the plane crashed when it hit a [microburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microburst) while landing at DFW, killing 8 of the 11 crew members and 126 of the 152 passengers on board, and one person on the ground. Two people later died 30 days or more after the crash, bringing the total fatalities to 137.

>A __thermal column__ (or __thermal__) is a column of rising [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air) in the lower altitudes of the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere). Thermals are created by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface from [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation), and are an example of [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection), specifically [atmospheric convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection). The [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it.  Dark earth, urban areas and roadways are good sources of thermals.

>The warmer air near the surface expands, becoming less [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density) than the surrounding air mass. The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools due to its expansion in the lower pressure of the higher altitude. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air. Associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the thermal column. The downward moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced at the top of the thermal.

>The size and [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics\)) of thermals are influenced by the properties of the lower atmosphere (the *[troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere)*). Generally, when the air is cold, bubbles of warm air are formed by the ground heating the air above it and can rise like a hot air balloon. The air is then said to be unstable. If there is a warm layer of air higher up, an [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_inversion) can prevent thermals from rising high and the air is said to be stable.

For about a month before my flight, I tracked the flight I would be getting online (there was only one per day). And that actually helped immensely seeing so many successful flights before mine, and they were always roughly the same length. My fear of flying is when we are in the air and experiencing turbulents. I experienced very bad ones coming home as we flew through/above hurricanes, but I used to just remind myself it's like driving a car on a bumpy road. Mostly, I just thought of what I was doing it for. In the day itself excitement took over. I actually felt impatient to get there rather than nervous of flying.

Sitting in first class, I could hear the caution alarms from the cockpit as we were on final approach, plane swaying left and right, moving up and down, until we finally touched down.  I kept looking at the flight attendant in her seat though... and she seemed perfectly fine.

One of the biggest golden rules I like to remind myself of is if the flight attendants aren't worried, you shouldn't be worried.  They're in the same plane as you, and they've probably flown the route on that plane hundreds of times before.  If they feel someone's in danger or something's not right, you're going to see it in them before anyone else.

Dealing with turbulence or oscillating motions... I like to tighten my seat belt and plant my feet onto the floor (almost like you're stomping it).  Don't know why, but I feel it helps me deal with the motions.  Could be since I'm moving with the plane instead of feeling like it's being allowed to throw me around.

I hate takeoff.  Always have, always will.  Not going to get into my reasons for it right now.  What gets me through takeoffs is the same methods I use for turbulence... and, I used to close my eyes.

I've also read that most people actually survive plane crashes if the plan remains in tact. The problem is that people do not get out fast enough, and the fuel burns through the casing. From what I've read, you have 30 seconds to get out of a plane before the fire reaches the cabin. This is why I choose seats at the edge of my aisle and by an emergency exit.

I kept myself distracted as possible by reading, watching movies, and listening to my downloaded music from Spotify + noise cancelling headphones. My awesome LDR bf also made an mp3 recording which lasted 2 hrs, so that helped a lot. I’m from LA and he’s from Italy so I was traveling for approx 13 hrs in total going there and 16 hrs coming back home.

I think the basis of my fear comes from the feeling of having absolutely no control.

My advice, start meditating leading up to the flight date and really try to calm yourself as you feel your panic rising.  I repeatedly think to myself 'I'm getting on the plane, the plane will takeoff, the plane will land, I'm getting off the plane.'

Day of the flight don't have too much coffee or caffeine as I've found that this doesn't help.  On the plane, I personally like sitting in the window seat with the window shade down with my spouse beside me as it makes me feel like I'm encapsulated in my own 'area', as in this is my comfort 'bubble'. 

You are going to need to breastfeed shortly after takeoff and as well as during the landing approach to help you baby's ears pressurize properly so this will help keep you occupied during these events.

Hopefully this helps.  You can do it!

Here's what at least mitigates my meltdowns:

* xanax. Many doctors will prescribe a small amount for us nervous flyers
* I may or may not enjoy the above a glass of wine, but clearly no one would ever actually green light that

""Don't you think I value my life? Do you think I think so little of myself and my family that I would take a job that puts me in jeopardy everyday??""

I am commenting because I recently found out I have the BRCA1 gene mutation passed down from my mother... who died at 45 from breast cancer. I do not have the ability to create proteins that protect me from breast cancer. 

I am 32 years old and my risk, right now, this very minute is 70%. I have done my research and risk goes up with age. There are things I have to change (and already am). I'm probably going to have all breast tissue removed (reducing my risk by 90-95%).

Am I scared? FUCK YES. Am I going to let it stop me from living my life? No.

I was the one who wanted to know, and I got my answer. I have the tools, doctors, and watchful eye of a mammogram and breast MRI every year that my mom never had. She never saw it coming because my family are a bunch of idiot assholes who are secretive and never talk about anything (my dad's adopted so not much there). I have the option to remove my breasts and potentially save my life.

I understand fear very well. I have general anxiety. Try asking your doctor for something called lorazepam (BUT - are you breast feeding? I'm not advocating this, just a suggestion, don't know how it could effect your little one) - I had a freak out in the hospital recently before my mammogram because I also have chronic pain among other things - and they weren't going to help me with the most painful of all of them (I also had a migraine on top of everything else) and there was some heavily drunk, high woman freaking out and screaming at the top of her lungs. I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm and leave.

They gave me Ativan (lorazepam) and my father is on this stuff - that's another story - and WOW. Instant calm. you just put it under your tongue and BAM.

I also don't understand why the in-laws can't drive down. It would be much easier for them to travel since they don't have an infant, but the step mom refuses to travel which is incredibly selfish of her - to complain about not seeing the baby but then expecting the OP and her husband to jump through hoops so she can see her granddaughter.

Everyone in this situation is going about it wrong. But if the husband would postpone the trip so his wife can get help then everyone would be happy and everyone would get what they want.",t3_2x8o48,1425006856,1,2/26/15 22:14,2x8o48

Inderal has helped so many people.  The tendency toward phobias tend to run in families (so reassure him that he may have been born with this).  

My daughter has also been successful with managing her phobia with buspar and inderal and then discontinued buspar and still doing well.  Inderal keeps the heart from racing, and all those physical symptoms (that feel like a heart attack) from happening.  Any family doctor should be willing to help him with this, as inderal at a lower dose is not filled with side effects.  He could start it the day or two before a trip.

Is there a chance his fear of flying is related to something that happened during his service? You said he WENT to a therapist.  Therapy isn't something you go once or twice and then you're done.

I very much value my strength through my adversities, so crying to me is a failure. I know it's emotionally healthy to cry and I shouldn't be embarrassed, and I do cry sometimes. But I have only cried in front of my current SO (none of my boyfriends prior) and that took a year. And for me, it was a huge sign that I trusted him enough to show those emotions. It was part of the reason I realized he was the one.

So, while you're struggling to see how to help him, he is already showing you that he trusts you with 'his deepest shame'. It *is* so frustrating to try so hard and still fail at what you set to do. And just think, he kept something like that in until you picked him up from the airport--you were the only one he felt comfortable opening that dam for.

So while he is an independent and strong man, he has given you signs that he trusts you with this problem. He shares his fears and vulnerabilities with you, you're in the best position to help. Many people here are giving great advice on what sort of help he might need, so I'm not going to lecture on that. Just sharing that you've been given permission essentially to provide support. 

I think, when approaching him with your help, the best method is to not change that position without his say--be his support, not his commander, in this problem. You say, ""I love you, I am sorry you are struggling, I'd like to help if that's okay, can I share some ideas?"". Let him stay in the drivers seat--he already feels loss of control, so make it clear he's in charge of this issue. If he gives you permission, ask ""what do you think of these ideas? I thought this one might be helpful because..."" Using suggestive, not commanding language. 

My boyfriend used to say things like, ""It is always your decision, and if you ever feel something isn't right for you, I trust you know what's best for you."" It made it clear that while I had final say, I had unwavering support and encouragement and that helped a lot. We've been together six years, and I have improved a lot with his support, if that means anything.

I'm afraid of spiders. I won't go so far as to say I'm arachnaphobic, because if it really comes down to it, I can deal with killing a spider if I have to.

But anyway, when I was younger I was just regular ""afraid of spiders"". Like, I'd see them and freak out a little.

And if that isn't the problem there are specialists that can help him diagnose the issue. 

I'm a Marine as well and I know it's tough for people like us to seek out help. 

Just do everything you can to let him know that you love and support him and that you don't think anything less of him, although probably don't mention that last bit unless he asks. 

Be ready with examples of how you don't consider him a failure to say in case he expresses that sentiment.  Tell him you are happy to talk things through and then give him space to decide when/if he wants that conversation to happen. 

I'm sure he's aware already but he's really lucky to have someone so supportive in his life. I wish you both lots of luck and I know you guys can make it through this. ",t3_35uyls,1431629455,1,5/14/15 14:50,35uyls

Therapy dogs are distinct from service dogs. Service dogs are trained to perform a specific service for their handler, such as seeing, hearing, or sending seizures or panic attacks. Therapy dogs are trained to provide emotional support, often to many people. You frequently find therapy dogs and other animals visiting hospitals, seniors' facilities, and psychiatric facilities. One hospital in my province has therapy dogs that come into the ER. I work at a college and we bring rabbits and therapy dogs in periodically to support students and staff and provide stress relief.
