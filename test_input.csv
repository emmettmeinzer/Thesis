7,"Therapy. Being a grown-ass woman who breaks down at the thought of getting on an airplane and says ""I don't care about the statistics. I don't trust pilots"" is not healthy.  You may not be a crazy person, but with regards to this issue, you are, and I think you owe it your husband, child, and self to try to address it with a professional before giving up on air travel for the rest of your life.  This is affecting your quality of life as well as your husband's.  it's not like I'm just scared of spiders or something It's exactly like that.  You have an irrational fear.  Just like someone who is afraid of spiders.  It's so real to YOU that you feel it's totally different from arachnophobia, but it's not.
